The script for parsing data on the indicator page has been customized. 
If in meta data the following is set to true: 
    data_non_statistical: true
There will be no diagramms showing. Instead, images in this folder will be loaded.

Images muss be named the same as the CSV data, with the same numbers e.g. 1-1-1.jpg, 2-1-2.png
So they could be found and placed under the same indicator.
